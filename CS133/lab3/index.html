    <h3>
      UNIX Processes
    </h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  I investigated UNIX processes using a few different commands. <br>
	  <code>ps</code> lists the current running processes in my instance on my username.<br>
	  I can use the <code>|</code> pipe operator to feed the stdout of one processes into the
	  stdin of another process. This can be combined with the <code>grep</code> command to filter
	  through the output of a command and only return what is desired.
	</p>
	<div class="code">
	  <mark>ps</mark> | <mark>grep</mark> kate
	</div>
	<p>
	  It is also possible to use the <code>pgrep</code> command to achieve a similar result.
    However, this only returns the PID of a process, rather than the complete list of useful information
    returned by <code>ps</code>, such as the running time, and owner of the process.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Terminating active processes in a particular bash instance / terminal
          can be done using <code>Ctrl+C</code>. When this becomes unresponsive, <code>Ctr+Z</code> can be used
          for a 'forced' or 'hard' stop / exit.
        </p>
        <p>
          When processes crash, the <code>pkill</code> command can be used in conjunction
          with <code>pgrep</code> in order to kill the process, by sending an appropriate 'kill' signal
          using the <code>--signal</code> argument in the command line.
        </p>
        <div class="code">

    </ol>

      <h3>Scripting</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          I created a script called <code>runloop.sh</code> using the following code from the lab webpage:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <mark>#!/bin/bash</mark> <br>
          javac Loop.java <br>
          java Loop <br>
        </div>
        <p>
          I also updated the script to make use of the <code>sleep</code> command so that
          the script would wait a few seconds before exiting.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          ... <br>
          <mark>sleep</mark> 5s
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using <code>chmod</code> I changed the execute permissions for the <code>runloop</code>
          script so that it can be executed from the command-line using <code>./runloop.sh</code>.
          Alternatively, <code>sh runloop</code> can also be used to run the script. The Advantage of
          updating the permissions as mentioned is that the script can then be placed in one of the directories
          linked to the <code>PATH</code> and used as a command from the command line.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <mark>chmod</mark> u+x runloop.sh
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I created another script this time to sum up 3 command-line arguments which are passed to it.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          sum=0 <br>
          sum=$(expr $1 + $2 + $3) <br>
          echo "$sum" <br>
          exit 0 <br>
        </div>
        <p>
          <code>expr</code> evaluates the succeeding code which sums up the 3 command-line arguments, while
          the enclosing <code>$(...)</code> essentailly takes the output from this evaluation, and saved it
          to the variable <code>sum</code> instead of printing it out to the stdout stream.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I then extended the script so that it checked to see if the number of arguments
          passed into the program are not exactly 3 by implementing an <code>if</code> statement.
          The if statement checks if <code>$#</code>, the number of command-line arguments is
          equal to 3. If so, then it prints the usage for the script using <code>echo</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          if [[ $#!=1 ]] <br>
          then <br>
              echo "Arguments entered: $#" <br>
              echo "Usage: ./sum {num1} {num2} {num3}" <br>
              exit 1 <br>
          fi <br>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I extended the script so that an unlimited number of arguments could be passed and then summmed appropriately.
          This was done using a <code>for</code> loop as can be seen below. The <code>a in $*</code> expression
          inside the for loop semantically means to iterate through each command-line argument passed as if it were
          an array of values, and to assign the value of the particular argument at that iteration to the variable
          <code>a</code>.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          for a in $* <br>
          do <br>
      	   case $a in <br>
		         -h) echo "HELP: Input any number of arguments (numbers) to be summed.">&2; exit 1;; <br>
		           [^0-9]*) echo "Arguments must be numbers.">&2; exit 1;; <br>
	              esac <br>

	               sum=$(($sum+$a)) <br>

	                #echo "$a" <br>
          done <br>
        </div>
        <p>
          Within the for loop I declared, there is some code which uses the <code>case</code> function
          and a regular expression in order to check if an argument <code>-h</code> is entered. If so, then the program will
          print the help message to the sterr stream indicated by the <code>&gt;&amp;2</code>. Otherwise, the program then sums all the arguments
          together. This is done using <code>$((..))</code> which also evaluates the expression within
          the parenthesis and assigns it to the variable specified much like the use of <code>expr</code> and
          the single set of surrounding parenthesis used previously.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the for loop terminates, the sum is completed and is printed to stdout.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For the final exercise I created a <code>pair</code> script which takes in an even
          number of arguments and prints out the sums of all the pairs passed.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          if [[ $#%2 -eq 1 ]] <br>
          then <br>
              echo "Please enter an even number of arguments" <br>
              exit 1 <br>
          fi <br><br>



          for (( i = 0 ; i < ${#argArray[@]} ; i=$i+2 )) <br>
          do <br> <br>

              sum=$((${argArray[${i}]}+${argArray[${i+1}]})) <br>
              echo "Pair Sum: of ${argArray[${i}]} and ${argArray[${i+1}]} = " $sum <br><br>

          done
        </div>
        <p>
          The <code>if</code> statement I declared uses the <code>%</code> modulo operator
          to check if the number of arguments are not divisble by two, indicating they would be odd.
          If so, the program prints out the usage statement and exits.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then declared a <code>for</code> loop which iterates through the command-line argments
          passed much in a similar way to how I did earlier. The key difference here is that the
          loop this time uses an iterator, <code>i</code> which increments by 2 each iteration, and treats the arguments ver much like an array.
          The benefit of doing this is so that my sum calculation done later on in the for loop can target
          the current element and the next so that they can be summed and then printed to the stdout stream.
        </p>
