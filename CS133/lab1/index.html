<h1>Lab 1: Introduction to Unix</h1>

<h2>Exercises:</h2>

<ol>
	<!--OLD I dont think this is really necessary... Not what I did at least.
	<li>

	  <p>We had to connect to joshua to run our commands. Here is what I typed</p>
	  <p class=code>ssh csudek@joshua</p>
	  <p>Apparently I can use PuTTY to do this from a Windows machine.</p>

	</li>
	-->

	<li>
	  <p>
	    The <code>cp</code> command requires a source and a destination.</p>
	    <div class=code><mark>cp</mark> ~nick/cs133/infotutorial .</div>
	    <p>This will copy the infotutorial script to my current directory.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    I also practiced using the <code>chmod</code> command to make my <code>public_html/</code>
	    directories and sub-folders readable by everyone so that my diary and portfolio can be
	    accessed by anyone.</p>
	    <div class="code">
	      <mark>chmod</mark> a+r file / directory
	      <mark>chmod</mark> a+x -R file / directory
	    </div>
			<p>
				I also needed to make sure that the files within the <code>public_html/</code> folder were
				accessible by <code>other</code> users. To do this I used:<br>
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				<mark>chmod</mark> o+r -R ~/public_html
			</div>
			<p>
				This essentially ensured that people would be able to view my webpages.
	  	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			I used <code>ls -l</code> to ensure that the permissions were correctly set up for each file.
		</p>
		<div class="code">
			ls -l
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			I also learned how to <code>ssh</code> into the DCS and work remotely.<br></br>
			The syntax is
		</p>
			<div class="code">
				<mark>ssh</mark> username@joshua.dcs.warwick.ac.uk
			</div>
			<p>
				followed by a password which is prompted by the server.
			</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			I had to unzip a file which I downloaded. I used <code>unzip</code> in the terminal to do this:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
			<mark>unzip</mark> file.zip
		</div>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			I learned how to execute scripts and other files in the terminal.
			To do this, first I need to make sure that the files are <code>executable</code> which
			an be ensured using the <code>chmod</code> command.<br></br>
			Then, files can be executed by referencing them as such in the terminal:
		</p>
		<div class="code">
			<mark>./file</mark>
		</div>
		<p>
			The <code>./</code> signifies that the executable file is to be located within the <b>current</b>
			directory, rather than just a general command.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			I was reminded on how to create directories with the <code>mkdir</code> command.
			I needed to make a few directories to organize my webpage structure and lab diaries for CS133.
		</p>
		<div class="code">
			<mark>mkdir</mark> CS133 <br>
			<mark>mkdir</mark> CS133/lab1 CS133/lab2 ... CS133/lab6
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			I created my <code>index.html</code> webpages using <code>touch</code>
		</p>
		<div class="code">
			<mark>touch</mark> index.html
		</div>
		<p>
			This created the index.html file. This index.html file is essentially what will
			be viewed when a user connects to my user webpage at <code>dcs.warick.ac.uk/~u1617781</code>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			I created a <code>name</code> file which stores my name within the <code>~/public_html/CS133/</code> directory.
			I needed to use the <code>chmod</code> command as outlined earlier to ensure that the file was readable and executable
			by all users.
		</p>
		<div class="code">
			<mark>echo</mark> "Aaron Baw" <mark>&gt;</mark> ~/public_html/CS133/name
		</div>
		<p>

		</p>
	</li>



</ol>
